This is a very big maze!
You need to find a way out!
This time you are a ball! Control yourself move to different directions. I'll build fences to block you. Your target is moving to the destination!
(I have several onsite interviews this week. So I skipped this game. But I found a README and screenshot is worth 0.5pts. That's why I have a README here!)
